# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the cybersecurity measures implemented in The Sakai Group website to protect against various types of attacks and vulnerabilities.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Purpose**: Prevents XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks
- **Implementation**: Meta tag and server headers
- **Policy**: Restricts resource loading to trusted sources only
- **Coverage**: Scripts, styles, images, fonts, and connections

### 2. HTTP Security Headers

#### X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Prevents MIME type confusion attacks
- Stops browsers from interpreting files as different MIME types

#### X-Frame-Options: DENY
- Prevents clickjacking attacks
- Stops the website from being embedded in iframes

#### X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Enables browser's built-in XSS filter
- Blocks pages when XSS attacks are detected

#### Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Controls referrer information sent with requests
- Enhances privacy and security

#### Permissions-Policy
- Disables unnecessary browser APIs
- Prevents unauthorized access to device features

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### HTML Entity Encoding
- Function: `SecurityUtils.escapeHtml()`
- Prevents XSS by encoding special characters
- Applied to all user inputs and dynamic content

#### Email Validation
- Function: `SecurityUtils.isValidEmail()`
- Validates email format and length
- Prevents email injection attacks

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Client-side**: JavaScript rate limiter for user actions
- **Server-side**: Configuration for Apache/Nginx
- **Protection**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
- **Limits**: 
  - Copy action: 5 attempts per 10 seconds
  - Scroll action: 10 attempts per 5 seconds

### 5. DOM Security Monitoring

#### MutationObserver
- Monitors DOM changes in real-time
- Detects injection of suspicious elements
- Logs potential security violations

#### Event Security
- Prevents drag and drop attacks
- Monitors hash changes for navigation attacks
- Validates hash length to prevent overflow attacks

### 6. CSP Violation Reporting
- Monitors Content Security Policy violations
- Logs security incidents for analysis
- Helps identify attack attempts

### 7. Server-Level Protection

#### Apache (.htaccess)
- Blocks access to sensitive files
- Filters malicious query strings
- Prevents directory traversal attacks
- Implements file access restrictions

#### Nginx (nginx-security.conf)
- Rate limiting with burst protection
- Request size limitations
- Timeout configurations
- Security headers enforcement

#### Vercel (vercel.json)
- Cloud platform security headers
- Function timeout limits
- Caching strategies for security

### 8. File Access Protection
- Blocks access to:
  - Configuration files (.env, .htaccess)
  - Log files and backups
  - Version control files (.git)
  - Temporary and sensitive files

### 9. Anti-Tampering Measures

#### Console Protection
- Disables console functions in production
- Prevents debugging and inspection (optional)

#### Optional Client-Side Protections
- Context menu disabling (commented out for accessibility)
- Developer tools blocking (commented out for accessibility)

## Attack Vectors Covered

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Reflected XSS**: Input validation and encoding
- **Stored XSS**: Content sanitization
- **DOM XSS**: Real-time DOM monitoring

### 2. Clickjacking
- **Protection**: X-Frame-Options and CSP frame-ancestors
- **Coverage**: Complete iframe blocking

### 3. MIME Type Attacks
- **Protection**: X-Content-Type-Options
- **Prevention**: MIME sniffing disabled

### 4. Injection Attacks
- **SQL Injection**: Input validation (for future database integration)
- **Command Injection**: Server-level filtering
- **HTML Injection**: Entity encoding

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Rate Limiting**: Multiple layers of protection
- **Resource Limits**: Request size and timeout limits
- **Client-side**: Action rate limiting

### 6. Information Disclosure
- **Server Headers**: Hidden server information
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in errors
- **Directory Listing**: Disabled

### 7. Session Attacks
- **Cookie Security**: HTTPOnly and Secure flags (for future sessions)
- **Session Management**: Best practices configured

## Deployment Considerations

### HTTPS Requirements
- Some security headers (HSTS) require HTTPS
- CSP works best with secure connections
- Cookie security flags need HTTPS

### Performance Impact
- Security headers add minimal overhead
- Rate limiting may affect high-traffic scenarios
- DOM monitoring has negligible performance impact

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers support all implemented features
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive security enhancement

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Security Logs
- CSP violation reports
- Rate limiting violations
- Suspicious activity detection

### Regular Updates
- Review and update CSP policies
- Monitor security headers effectiveness
- Update rate limiting parameters as needed

### Incident Response
- Log analysis procedures
- Security violation investigation
- Attack pattern identification

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. HTTPS Implementation
- Enable HTTPS for all environments
- Implement HSTS headers
- Use secure cookie settings

### 2. Regular Security Audits
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Code security reviews

### 3. Backup and Recovery
- Regular security backups
- Incident recovery procedures
- Data integrity verification

### 4. User Education
- Security awareness training
- Safe browsing practices
- Incident reporting procedures

## Configuration Files

### .htaccess (Apache)
- Complete server-level security configuration
- File access restrictions
- Attack pattern filtering

### nginx-security.conf (Nginx)
- Nginx-specific security settings
- Rate limiting configuration
- Security headers setup

### vercel.json (Vercel)
- Cloud platform security headers
- Function security settings
- Caching security policies

## Testing and Validation

### Security Testing Tools
- Browser developer tools for CSP testing
- Online security header analyzers
- XSS testing frameworks

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] CSP headers properly configured
- [ ] XSS protection active
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] File access restrictions working
- [ ] Security monitoring active

This comprehensive security implementation provides multiple layers of protection against common web vulnerabilities while maintaining website functionality and user experience.
